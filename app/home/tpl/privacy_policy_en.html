        </ol>
        <p>We strive to maintain the appropriate standards of security and we have put in place robust technical and
                organisational measures for the protection of your Personal Data in accordance with the current state of
                the art technologies, especially to protect the data against loss, falsification or access by
                unauthorised third persons. For the transfer of particularly sensible Personal Data via the internet,
                such as credit card details, we exclusively use encrypted transmission routes and we comply with the
                Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) which is a set of policies and procedures
                intended to optimise the security of credit, debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders
                against misuse of their personal information. However, the transmission of information via the internet
                is not completely secure. So, whilst we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot
                guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Online Store. Any transmission is at your own
                risk. Once we have received your personal data, we will use strict procedures and security features to
                prevent unauthorised access. As far as third parties (i.e. external companies) are rendering data
                processing services for us, we have committed them to the compliance with our data privacy regulations.
